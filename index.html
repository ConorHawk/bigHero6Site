						<h3>Hiro Hamada</h3>
						<p>Hiro Hamada has the mind of a genius and the heart of a 14-year-old: his amazing battle-bots dominate the underground bot fights. But when a tragic event changes everything, Hiro turns to a robot named Baymax, and they form an unbreakable bond becoming part of a band of high-tech heroes on a very important mission.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="char-info baymax-info">
						<h3>Baymax</h3>
						<p>Baymax cares. That's what he was designed to do. The plus-sized inflatable robot's job title is technically "Healthcare Companion", and was created and built by Tadashi Hamada. But to the inventor's kid brother Hiro, Baymax turns out to be more than what he was built for—he's a hero, and quite possibly Hiro's closest friend. After some clever reprogramming that includes a rocket fist, super strength and rocket thrusters that allow him to fly, Baymax becomes one of the Big Hero 6.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="char-info gogo-info">
						<h3>Go Go Tomago</h3>
						<p>Go Go Tomago knows what it takes to be fast. She's tough, athletic and loyal to the bone, but not much of a talker. Popping bubble gum and delivering well-placed sarcasm are totally her speed. The daredevil adrenaline junkie is at her best on wheels, and when Go Go joins forces with Big Hero 6, she rolls like never before, using maglev discs as wheels, shields and throwing weapons.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="char-info honey-info">
						<h3>Honey</h3>
						<p>It's elemental when it comes to chemistry whiz HONEY LEMON. Don't let her glasses and funky fashion fool you: Honey may be as sweet as her namesake, but she has a fire in her belly and a can-do attitude that make her pretty much unstoppable. Her knowledge of alchemy proves powerful, too, when the effusive brainiac becomes part of the "Big Hero 6" and creates clever concoctions that when thrown, can get her team out of nearly any jam.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="char-info wasabi-info">
						<h3>Wasabi</h3>
						<p>Wasabi is committed to precision. He's super smart and just a touch uptight, but can't help but join the cause when Hiro needs him most. As part of Big Hero 6, Wasabi amplifies his martial arts skills with jaw-dropping plasma blade weaponry. Sharp doesn't even begin to describe this guy.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="char-info fred-info">
						<h3>Fred</h3>
						<p>Fanboy Fred comes off like a laid-back dude with no direction. But this sign-twirling, monster-loving, comic-book lover is sure to go places. When he's good and ready. For example, Fred doesn't hesitate to join Big Hero 6, and he has a lot of ideas for his super-hero skills, too. His ferocious, fire-breathing alter ego comes complete with claws, integrated communications and a super bounce.</p>
